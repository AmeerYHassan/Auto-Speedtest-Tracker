# Automatic Speedtest Tracker

This application serves as an automatic internet speed tracker. Speedtests are performed at a set interval in Python and stored in a json file. The contents of the json file is then displayed on a React website utilizing chart.js to display the information.

The MVP for this application is complete and can be launched by anyone. Right now, it only shows one chart with all of the speed test results.

Future Features:

- Separating tests per-day
- Generated statistics per day
- User-defined intervals for how often to run a test
